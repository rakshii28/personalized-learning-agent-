Cellular Respiration: The Krebs cycle is the central hub for energy production. It involves multiple steps. **Visual learners** must use the detailed metabolic pathway diagram

 to see how NADH and FADH2 are produced.

Anatomy: The path of blood flow through the heart is crucial. **Auditory learners** should listen to a clear audio recording that verbally describes the journey: Vena Cava -> Right Atrium -> Right Ventricle -> Lungs...

Genetics: Mendelian inheritance problems involve using Punnett squares. **Kinesthetic learners** should use practice problem set 4.2 to physically map out crosses (monohybrid and dihybrid) and calculate probability ratios.

Ecology: Trophic levels describe the flow of energy. **Reading/Writing learners** should define primary producers, consumers, and decomposers, and write an essay summarizing the 10% energy transfer rule.

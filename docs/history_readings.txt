World War I Causes: The primary factors were Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, and Nationalism (M.A.I.N.). **Reading/Writing learners** should outline the arguments connecting each of these factors to the start of the war.

Essay Structure: A strong history essay requires a clear thesis statement, topic sentences, and evidence. **Kinesthetic learners** should write a full draft of a thesis and supporting points on the American Revolution before beginning the full essay.

Philosophy: Existentialism focuses on individual freedom and responsibility. **Auditory learners** can benefit from joining a discussion group to debate Sartre's "Existence precedes essence."

Civil Rights Movement: Key dates and legislative acts define this period. **Visual learners** should create a chronological timeline from the Brown v. Board decision (1954) to the Voting Rights Act (1965).
